# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project by both internal and external parties

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository into your own github account (external contributors) or create a new branch (internal
   contributions)
1. Make your code changes
1. Ensure you commit message is descriptive as it acts as the changelog. Mark any breaking changes with `BREAKING`.
   Include a rectification strategy if you introduce a `BREAKING` change.
1. Ensure `README.md` is updated if needed. All code samples in the README should have corresponding (actual sames) in the various docs/ folders
1. Submit a pull request back to `master` branch (or the branch you are contributing to)
1. Ensure Github Actions build passes
1. Await reviews
1. Once merged into `master` a `SNAPSHOT` build will be available for consumption
   immediately [here](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/io/github/origin-energy/). Note that
   snapshots change regularly and cannot be relied upon.
1. Hard Releases will be made once enough features have been added.

## Building

```java
./gradlew shadowJar
```

## Deploying locally and deploying to `.m2/`

```
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

Ensure you add `mavenLocal()` to your consuming project and the dependency verison matches that in your local `.m2`
folder

# Uploading to maven central
see `.github/workflows/release.yml`

# Uploading to maven central (manually)

Gradle release plugin is not currently working so this is a manual process at the moment.

# Setup GPG on your machine

1. copy the GPG Private key into a file `private.key`
1. run

```
gpg --import private.key
cd ~/.gnupg
gpg -k
gpg --export-secret-key YOUR_KEY_ID > ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg
```

## Preparing

1. Create a tag `X.X.X`
1. Update `gradle.properties` and remove `-SNAPSHOT` from the version number
1. Check this file into version control and push the branch to the remote
1. run

```
export SONAR_USERNAME=?
export SONAR_PASSWORD=?
export GPG_KEY_ID=?
export GPG_KEY_PASSPHRASE=?
export PATH_TO_SECRING_GPG=~/.gnupg/secring.gpg

# I found shadowed classes are not included if you don't separate the gradle operations
./gradlew clean shadowJar
./gradlew signArchives uploadArchives -PossrhUsername=${SONAR_USERNAME} -PossrhPassword=${SONAR_PASSWORD} -Psigning.keyId=${GPG_KEY_ID} -Psigning.password=${GPG_KEY_PASSPHRASE} -Psigning.secretKeyRingFile=${PATH_TO_SECRING_GPG}
```

## Releasing [Full Tutorial](https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html)

   visible
1. Press the 'Release' button and give a reason for releasing
1. Objects should be available in about 10 min (Longer for search.maven.org)

## Cleanup

1. Checkout master branch
